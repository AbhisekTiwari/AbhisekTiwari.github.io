    responsibilities:
    - In a task-oriented dialogue system, task completion is the utmost priority of both end-users and the dialogue agent. However, existing dialogue agents completely flatter
      in case of some adversarial situations such as goal unavailability. We formulated a unique Markov decision process (MDP) with a cumulative reward model (task-based, sentiment-
      based, and persuasion-based) for simultaneously reinforcing task-specific, user-adaptive and personalized persuasive behavior, and optimized dialogue policy using reinforcement learning techniques. The obtained results and comparisons with different baselines and state-of-
      the-art methods firmly establish the role of dynamic and context driven personalized persuasive dialogue system over non-persuasive and fixed strategy based persuasive dialoguesystems.
